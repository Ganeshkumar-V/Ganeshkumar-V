**`Rocket Propulsion, Computational Fluid Dynamics, High-Performance Computing`**

I am a PhD Scholar at IIT Gandhinagar working on Rocket Propulsion Projects. I use advanced CFD techniques to predict the performance of the rocket motors. I'm also an OpenFOAM developer, envisioning complex CFD frameworks which include multiple physics using OpenFOAM.
