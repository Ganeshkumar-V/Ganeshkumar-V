**`Rocket Propulsion, Computational Fluid Dynamics, High-Performance Computing, OpenFOAM`**

I am a doctoral candidate at IIT Gandhinagar, specializing in Rocket Propulsion and Combustion, with a particular focus on energetic materials. My research involves the development of multiphase Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solvers aimed at accurately predicting the performance of rocket motors. I envision and execute my projects by developing sophisticated CFD frameworks within the OpenFOAM platform.
